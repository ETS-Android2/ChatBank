# ChatBank Application

## Introduction
ChatBank is an android chat bot application which is 100% automated and includes a back and forth “chat” designed to hone in on the precise question or request. 
They are a boon to mobile self-service, where the limitations of screen size make traditional net banking less user-friendly. The authentication is through the account number/CRN and cPIN (unique key) provided by bank.
